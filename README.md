# Weekend jQuery Server Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 12 hours_

For this project, I created a calculator that is able to run basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This was also created with Node Express which gives it a server side to store the calculation history after it is rendered to the DOM.
